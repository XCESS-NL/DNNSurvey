# DNNSurvey
DNN Survey module MVC based

Project Description
===================
The Survey module displays a survey consisting ofone or more survey questions. Questions can have either a single or multiple choice answers. One answer to a question can be selected as the correct response, thereby enabling the survey to function as a quiz. Authorized users can submit their response to the survey and/or can view current survey results. The Survey uses cookies to remember which computers have already submitted a response to the survey, reducing the opportunity for one person to answer the survey repeatedly. 
Optional features include the ability to set a closing date for submitting responses to the survey, and the ability to set the width of the results graph.
